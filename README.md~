Found a resource online that showed me how to do facebook graph api calls/looked at documentation:

Found references online to refresh my memory on how to use certain jquery functions, but code logic is essentially thought up by myself.

Directions:
Enter in a query in the input box e.g. coffee, restaurants austin, etc. Then click on the "Get Results" button. You must click on it and not just press enter for the results to show up underneath.

Further work:
If I had time, I would clean up the UI. Add more flexible query functionality like have an input box with a city and state.
